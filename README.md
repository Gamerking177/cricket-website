Create a new branch before making any changes:

#git checkout -b new-feature-branch
Commit changes when theyâ€™re done with their feature:


#git add .
#git commit -m "Description of the feature or fix"
Push the changes to the remote repository:


#git push origin new-feature-branch
5. Opening a Pull Request (PR)
Once the changes are pushed, your friend can open a pull request to have the changes reviewed and merged into the main branch.

Go to the GitHub repository.
Click on the Pull requests tab.
Click on New pull request.
Select their branch and compare it with the main branch, then create the PR.
6. Syncing with the Latest Code
If any changes are made by others, your friend can pull the latest changes by running:

git pull origin main
This will pull the latest changes from the main branch to keep their local copy up-to-date.
